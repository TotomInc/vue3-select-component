# Events

Currently, Vue 3 Select Component doesn't emit any custom events, except for the native `v-model` one.

If you have the need for custom events, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TotomInc/vue3-select-component) with your use case and we will be happy to investigate it.
